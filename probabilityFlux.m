% function [probMap, fluxField] = probabilityFlux(tseries,dt,dx,cutoff)
%
% This function takes a 2D time series and calculates the probability
% flux of the time series moving through the 2D space. Inspired by
% Battle et al. (Science 2016)
%
% INPUTS:     tseries - Nx2 matrix, each column is a time series in 
%                       one variable
%                  dt - time interval between each row of data in tseries
%                dbin - Size of bins (in um), equal in both directions
%              cutoff - (optional), if passed, an integer number of standard
%                       deviations out to which the bins go. Pass [] to just use
%                       max and min of data given.
%
% OUTPUTS:    probMap - (nbiny)x(nbinx) histogram of probability distribution of 
%                       phase space, estimated as time spent in each coarse
%                       grained bin in phase space 
%           fluxField - (nbiny)x(nbinx)x2 matrix, containing x and y components 
%                       of the time averaged flux vector field
